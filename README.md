Welcome to Premier Fun, where we will play around with 
Python pandas and seaborn library to create some beautiful 
Data Visualization using the Premier League Data

We will use the data from past seasons to create the visualization and analysis 
this analysis will be re usuble as long as the user innputs the data into a defined json format
